(These test scripts require that the NicTool client library be installed on the
system or be located in the directory "../sys/client" relative to the directory
this README is located in.)

NOTE: 
    To run the test scripts you must modify the file test.cfg in this directory.
It specifies how to connect to your NicToolServer and what the username and 
password should be.
    The username/password should probably be that of the root user. It is assumed
in some tests that the user you specify here is root.  

    In either case, the username is used to log in to your server and perform a
multitude of tests. 

NOTE: The scripts will create and delete a LOT of objects, which remain in the
database. After testing, you might want to reload the database tables from the
included SQL scripts or from your backups.

    Each script is good about cleaning up after itself even if there is some error
which causes a failure at some point.  However, some failures may cause residual 
objects to be left on the server. You can delete the objects manually or use the
enclosed "cleanup.pl" script to recursively delete all the objects in an entire 
subgroup. Since it will not ask you if you are sure you want to do so, be SURE 
that the nt_group_id you give to it is the one you want to delete.  

    There are some things which currently have no test script written for them,
these are probably listed in the TODO document.  Feel free to add more to the
list and/or to create the tests yourself :)
