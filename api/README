This is a short README to introduce the client framework for NicTool.  It consists of the NicTool.pm module and various subpackages.
To use this client framework you need to have a working installation of NicToolServer .

There are a number of objects in the NicTool system, and they are represented as follows:

group       - NicTool::Group
user        - NicTool::User
zone        - NicTool::Zone
record      - NicTool::Record
nameserver  - NicTool::Nameserver

Some functions in the NicTool API return lists of objects.  A list is represented by:

list        - NicTool::List

Every time a function is called, the object that is returned is an instance of NicTool::Result
which has the following methods:


NicTool::Result::error_code -   returns the numerical error code
NicTool::Result::error_msg  -   returns the textual error message
NicTool::Result::is_error   -   returns TRUE if the error code is not '200'

Every type of object is a subclass of NicTool::Result 

2011 - UPDATE

In the contrib directory are examples of how to use the NicTool API.

DNS.pm is a good example of how to encapsulate NicTool API methods for automated use.

For a modern high(er) quality example, check out the NicTool module from Provision::Unix. You can find Provision::Unix on CPAN.

For a complete working example donated by ColocateUSA Inc., download the ColoUSA package from http://www.nictool.com/download/ColoUSA-1.02.tar.gz  Included in the package are scripts for resetting rDNS (via CGI or CLI) and updating a hostname (PTRs, A, AAAA).
